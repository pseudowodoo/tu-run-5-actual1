# Web App Requirements

To pass the programme, your web app will need to fulfil the following requirements.

## **A. Product-level Requirements:**

1. You have clearly formulated a **robust problem statement**, and that your web app clearly is aimed to address this problem, through its features and design. Your problem statement should be **suitably scoped**, and should show clarity of:
   1. the specific target **user** group
   2. **pain-points**
   3. **consequences** of the problem if it remains unsolved
2. You have devised suitable metrics to measure the success of your product. Your selected metrics should:&#x20;
   1. Be **SMART** - i.e., specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-based
   2. Show a clear distinction between **leading and lagging indicators**
3. You have **developed and tested your prototype** with users, to:
   1. ascertain that your **assumptions/ hypotheses** are valid; and
   2. that the **user experience** is intuitive and effective

## **B. Hard Technical Requirements:**

For your app to score a passing grade, your app should also demonstrate the following:

1. Possess both the front-end interface and backend functions;&#x20;
2. Working functionally as intended
3. Developed either manually or through the use of AI-assistend product development platforms (e.g., Lovable, GitHub Copilot)
   1. Note: you are free to use whichever tool you prefer for this course.
4. Successfully deployed to the internet, with a custom domain name.&#x20;

You will be guided on how to meet both product-level and hard technical requirements across the TechUp Programme. You are required to present your web app during the Evaluation Day.
