## How would WAP Day look like?

* During your scheduled slot, you should report as a group to the _Collab Room (Level 1)_.
* One-by-one, you will be asked to individually present your app before a group of seasoned PM and UX Design practitioners, who will serve as your evaluators. Each presenter gets around 8 mins, which comprises:
  * 5-mins presentation
  * 3-mins Q\&A, in which the evaluators would ask probing questions and share their feedback.

## What should I need to present?

During the allocated 5 mins of presentation time, you should focus on covering the following:

1. **State your problem statement:**
   * Recall: your problem statement should contain a clear and sound description of your (i) target users, (ii) pain-points, and (iii) consequences (if the problem is not addressed)
2. **Describe your web app and its key features**
   * Explain what your web app does; and summarize the key features that enable your app to address the problem statement in #1
   * Elaborate on the thought process on how you decided on included these features, e.g., based on the insights you've gathered from your user interviews
3. **Walk through the user flow**
   * Perform 1-2 demonstrations with your web app, to show how a prospective user might use the app to achieve his/her intended outcomes.

## What will the evaluators primarily be looking out for?

_The evaluators will mainly be looking for the following:_

**A. Problem Statement:** In your formulation of the problem statement, is there clarity and soundness in the following:

1. Target Users
2. Pain-Points
3. Consequences, if the problem is not addressed?

Your problem statement should not be a mere restatement of what you have crafted in Week 1; you should be able to briefly share your post-interview/ research insights to further validate the assumptions/ hypotheses in your problem statement.

**B. Product Suitability:**

1. The extent to which your app's **features address the stated problem statement** in (A)
2. The **effectiveness of your app's UX** in supporting/ facilitating the user journey
3. The extent to which the app is **functioning as intended**

## What do I need to Prepare or Bring?

* Your webapp should have been completed and gone live, in the form of a publicly-accessible URL, by the time of WAP day.
* During WAP day, you should bring along a **laptop** that would allow you to display your webapp and demonstrate the user flow.
* Presentation slides are optional; you may wish to consider using them if they help in delivering your point across effectively.

Here's wishing you the best of luck for WAP day! :tada:
