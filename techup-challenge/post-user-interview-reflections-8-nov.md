# ðŸŽ¤ Post-User Interview Reflections (16th May)

By Week 2 of the programme, you should have built your prototype and tested it with your users. The deliverable by the end of week 2 would be your **reflections**, arising from the user interviews.&#x20;

### What should I do?

Your next steps are to:&#x20;

1. Build a suitable prototype that helps test your key assumptions inherent in your problem statement
   1. _Recall: prototypes can take many forms -- e.g., role playing, storyboarding, paper prototyping/ wireframes, clickable prototypes. Pick the prototype that best fits your needs!_
2. Recruit \~2 prospective users who fit the profile of your target user, and conduct user interviews with these users.&#x20;
3. With the insights you collected, share your reflections with us in the [Deliverables Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cCWx5g22qLU5U8YZYe06XptQjVIBwHVbDxa-_4u-oNw/edit?usp=sharing). \

Your reflections for this week should include:&#x20;

1. What key insights have you gained from the user interviews?&#x20;
   1. Has your conversations with users validated or challenged your initial assumptions about your problem statements?&#x20;
   2. What have you learned about your users, in relation to: their pain-points; their preferences; their user flow? &#x20;
2. What proposed changes would you be making to your web app, in light of the insights gained from your user interviews?&#x20;
3. Would there be any changes you would be making to your problem statements and the direction of the web app you would be building?
   1. _If yes, please submit a re-write of your problem statements and the web app in the relevant columns (2nd iteration). If there are no changes, simply copy and paste your writeup over._&#x20;
