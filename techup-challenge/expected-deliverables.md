## **Your TechUp Challenge**

In the TechUp Programme, your end goal would be to develop a **functional web application** **that solves a problem of your choice**. To do so, you will need to wear the following hats throughout the course:

* _Product Manager_: who perceptively identify the right needs/ problems and, in an agile manner, develops a suitable product in service of these needs
* _UX Designer_: who employs an iterative, experimental and human-centered approach in product design to build a product that is attuned to serving its end-users
* _Web App Developer_: who employs computational thinking and coding skills to translate design and product ideas into an actual product for use.

All TechUp Participants must complete this challenge before they could be deemed as having passed this programme.

## **Your Milestones (the 3Ps)**

To achieve this goal, there are three milestones (the _3P's_) that await you in this TechUp journey:

1. **Milestone 1: Define the Right Problem**\
   A good product is defined by the kind of problem that it's intended to solve. Have you identified a problem that is clearly defined and scoped, for a clear group of target users; and which merits solving?\

2. **Milestone 2: Prototype your Idea towards Success**\
   Nobody builds a product right at the first try. To ensure that your hypotheses about your intended product's desirability are valid, you will need to build workable prototypes and, importantly, _test_ them with actual users to gather key insights that could shape your ideas towards building a stronger product.\

3. **Milestone 3: Build and Showcase your Product**\
   Now it's time to start putting your ideas into action! With your newfound web development skills, start building your web application that approximates the product idea you have.\
